- 👋 Hi, I’m @TheLangdaTyagi
- 👀 I’m interested in making simple yet robust applications and coming up with new ideas and figuring out how to implement them!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ionic after working on hybrid apps for the first time way back in 2014 and having lost touch until recently in March 2021.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on brilliant ideas in the future, but for now I'm just looking to learn more and explore on my own.
- 📫 How to reach me ... isn't available yet ;)
